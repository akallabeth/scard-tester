This is a simple test application for windows SCard API

Main purpose is to get some test coverage for the RDP smartcard redirection API of freerdp.

How to use:

1. Connect with your favorite `FreeRDP` based client with enabled smartcard support (and hopefully a reader attached)
2. Run this test application on the remote windows machine you are connecting to
3. This test application finishes and the client does not abort/crash/eat your sandwich
